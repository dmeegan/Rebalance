## Add Stock to your Portfolio

Input a stock symbol, company name or keyword into the search bar and click the Add Stock button. Using the Alpha Vantage Search Endpoint API, Rebalance will return the stock that best matches your input. After determining the most appropriate stock associated with your input, the program then uses the Alpha Vantage Global Quote API to return that stock's current price. The stock symbol, stock name, and current price will be added to your Portfolio.

## Set Current Percentages

Once a stock has been added to your portfolio, Rebalance allows you to set the current quantity of shares of that stock that you own. When you set the current quantity, the program will automatically calculate the total market value of that stock, the Current Total Asset value of your Portfolio, and the current percentage of your Portfolio that each stock makes up.

OK, but What if I want to add value to my account and I want to make sure I maintain my target percentage?
